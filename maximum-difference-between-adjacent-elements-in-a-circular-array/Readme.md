# [3423. Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-adjacent-elements-in-a-circular-array)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

Given a circular array nums, find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.

Note: In a circular array, the first and last elements are adjacent.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

Because nums is circular, nums[0] and nums[2] are adjacent. They have the maximum absolute difference of |4 - 1| = 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-5,-10,-5]

Output: 5

Explanation:

The adjacent elements nums[0] and nums[1] have the maximum absolute difference of |-5 - (-10)| = 5.

 

Constraints:

    2 <= nums.length <= 100

    -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

Hint 1

Traverse from the second element to the last element and check the difference of every adjacent pair.

Hint 2

The edge case is to check the difference between the first and last elements.
